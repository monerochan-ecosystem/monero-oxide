# Helios/Selene (Helioselene)

tevador proposed Helios and Selene in a [GitHub Gist](
  https://gist.github.com/tevador/4524c2092178df08996487d4e272b096
). The curves were found using a Sage script, Helios and Selene being the first
pair of elliptic curves to:
- Have a 255-bit $q$
- Have $3 \cong 4 \mod q$
- Have $(2^{256} \mod q) < 2^{128}$
- Have a secure twist

The Monero project [sponsored a competition](
  https://github.com/j-berman/fcmp-plus-plus-optimization-competition
) for an efficient implementation. This library has not undergone any audits at
this time.
